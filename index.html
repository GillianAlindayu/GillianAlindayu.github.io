                    <strong>
                    My name is Gillian, just living in a normal life and welcome to my art gallery.
                    
                    As a student, I worked as a professional artist. 
                    I started drawing at a very young age to pursue my passion for making different projects through art as I allow myself. 
                    So here is my interactive website of my artworks in this portfolio website. </strong></p>
    
                <p class="paragraph2"><strong>I started my art career ever since at the very young age. And back then it got my attention since I have a full interest of making 
                    artworks as my hobby. And even whenever I watched a random show or a series that I am interest in , I kinda like wanted to make an artwork out of it. 
                    Because it gave me much interest to make them. In the end, It became my hobby and inspired me well. </strong>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph3"><strong>And at the current, I started to post my drawings on instagram in every free time when I wanted to. 
                    But suddenly stopped due to projects and assessments since it is way getting complicated and too busy to make artworks. 
                    And since I planned to make this portfolio website, here are my iconic artworks that will get everyone's attention. </strong>
