            <p class="descrption">
                My name is Gillian, just living in a normal life and welcome to my art gallery.
                
                As a student, I worked as a professional artist. 
                I started drawing at a very young age to pursue my passion for making different projects through art as I allow myself. 
                So here is my interactive website of my artworks in this portfolio website.</p>

            <p class="paragraph2">I started my art career ever since at the very young age. And back then it got my attention since I have a full interest of making 
                artworks as my hobby. And even whenever I watched a random show or a series that I am interest in , I kinda like wanted to make an artwork out of it. 
                Because it gave me much interest to make them. In the end, It became my hobby and inspired me well. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph3">And at the current, I started to post my drawings on instagram in every free time when I wanted to. 
                But suddenly stopped due to projects and assessments since it is way getting complicated and too busy to make artworks. 
                And since I planned to make this portfolio website, here are my iconic artworks that will get everyone's attention. 
            </p>
