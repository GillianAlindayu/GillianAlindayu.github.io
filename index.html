                <p class="descrption">
                    My name is Gillian, just living in a normal life and welcome to my art gallery.
                    
                    As a student, I worked as a professional artist. 
                    I started drawing at a very young age to pursue my passion for making different projects through art as I allow myself. 
                    So here is my interactive website of my artworks in this portfolio website.</p>
    
                <p class="paragraph2">I started my art career ever since at the very young age. And back then it got my attention since I have a full interest of making 
                    artworks as my hobby. And even whenever I watched a random show or a series that I am interest in , I kinda like wanted to make an artwork out of it. 
                    Because it gave me much interest to make them. In the end, It became my hobby and inspired me well. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph3">And at the current, I started to post my drawings on instagram in every free time when I wanted to. 
                    But suddenly stopped due to projects and assessments since it is way getting complicated and too busy to make artworks. 
                    And since I planned to make this portfolio website, here are my iconic artworks that will get everyone's attention.

                    <p class="edited photos">
                        here are the edited photos with digital art basis that is used in photoshop. These photos was edited in pics art. Which is basically 
                        from a mobile.
                    </p>
                    <p class="photo">
                        The first picture is just myself getting edited. The title of that edited image is snowblind. Which is inspired by the mortal 
                        kombat series. The second image is just an image of my hand namely the magma fist. The third images explains my injury, and it's basically 
                        inspired from the attack on titan series because things may go different when I looked at myself getting injured, I had an idea of making 
                        this artwork of myself turning into a titan. The fourth picture explains my previous dream, it is not actually a painting, but it's just inserting 
                        other images to make it like a realistic like it's from a film or a game that I've been through. The fifth image is just myself with a different eye color. 
                        The name of the image is called the ocean eyes which is actually my old userame eversince as a youth. 
                        The fourth picture explains the imaginable dark sketch. It's just an inky sketch of a girl on a swing. It's not in the actual sketch, 
                        but it is just an imagination after I am drew a tree. The fourth images is just me at the beach as i can imagine myself in the interstellar movie with 
                        inspiration. The eighth picture is captured when I am on the band performance. And his guitar pick was inspired from Genshin Impact as 
                        the guitar pick inspires the constellation of Master Diluc in the game. The last image explains my greatest nightmare after I woke up from it. 
                        The whole night, I was dreaming about fighting a titan, and right after I woke up, I looked at the wall, I imagined a titan was just there staring at my soul,
                        and I immediately grabbed my phone, and start editing of myself battling against a titan. Since Attack on titan is one of my favorite 
                        show as a youth and until now.
