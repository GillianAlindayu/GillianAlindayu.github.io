                <p class="shadowintro"><strong>Here are the minimal artworks, they're all in shadows, no faces and not much designs just the figures of their body 
                    and the background colors. It is one of my skills in digital art that can make things with minimal artworks. It was a fun thing to do or to
                    make them because it is way satisfying to others as well. Sometimes it took me like an hour or 30 mins to create them, because some of the details 
                    are way complicated, or it will be a problem if you just get it from other artists. But what makes it simpler, is to just get some elements to create a
                    better idea to make them. </strong>

                    Alucard against Diluc Ragnivndr. I had an idea of making this kind of crossover since I just discovered my new favorite character
                    from Genshin, which is Diluc and my other main from a different game which is alucard. After making this epic artwork that I've been 
                    through, it gave me goosebumps to make this crossover.</strong>
